# NeuralNetworks_homeworks
Homeworks from university course 'Architecture of neural networks for deep learning'

+ **HW1** - basic knowledge of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), building of each CNN step using only NumPy lib
+ **HW2** - semantic segmentation problem, building [Unet](https://lmb.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/people/ronneber/u-net/) with TensorFlow, testing with [The Oxford-IIIT Pet dataset ](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/pets/)
