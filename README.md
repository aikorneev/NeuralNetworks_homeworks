# NeuralNetworks_homeworks
This repository contains homeworks from university course 'Architecture of neural networks for deep learning'.

+ **HW1** - basic knowledge of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), building of each CNN step using only NumPy lib
+ **HW2** - semantic segmentation problem, building [U-net](https://lmb.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/people/ronneber/u-net/) with TensorFlow, testing with [The Oxford-IIIT Pet dataset](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/pets/) 
+ **HW3** - RNN introduction, SeqToSeq model and LSTM are used for translation system building with PyTorch lib.
+ **HW4** - Music generation, using LSTM and WaveNet models.
+ **HW5** - LSTM-based siamese model + Sentence BERT for duplicates detection.
